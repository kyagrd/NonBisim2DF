# Quasi-Open Bisimilarity with Mismatch is Intuitionistic
 
* `quasi-finpi.thm` : Abella proof script that contains
     - logical embeddings of the transition semantics of the pi-calculus with mismatch, quasi-open bisimilarity, and the modal logic (intuitionistic FM);
     - their properties (equivalence and congruence of quasi-open bisimilarity, soundness of quasi-open bisimilarity with respect to the modal logic, and partially mechanized completeness of quasi-open bisimilarity with respect to the modal logic);
     - and all the examples in the draft mechanically checked using the definitions in Abella.
* `quasi-finpi.html` : html output of the proof script (easier to browse through the definitions with the proof content folded -- can click on to see the details of tactics).
* `quasi-finpi.html` : html output of the interactive output of the Abella proof state step-by-step after each proof tactic command.
